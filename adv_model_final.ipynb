    "\n",
    "The main difference between our advanced model and the baseline model is that in this advanced approach we attempted to train and fine tune the BART-base model for our text summarization task, rather than just using the BART-base model in its original form as we did with our baseline model. After strategies for fine-tuning and specializing transformer models were discussed in class, we wanted to try this with our model. BART, as a pretrained model, is very effective at text summarization out of the box, but we thought fine-tuning our model could potentially provide significant performance gains and make the model better at text summarization specifically. After some research, we found that BERT models seem to have far more examples of fine-tuning and task-oriented specialization than BART models, but we wanted to keep the same core transformer architecture as the baseline model to provide the best possible performance comparison. We were eventually able to find an example of someone fine-tuning a BART model for a specific task (linked in the towards data science article below), so we used that article and its associated google colab notebook as inspiration for model training and fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "A change from the baseline model to this one that was a direct result of baseline performance is the adjustment we made to our \"runBART\" prediction function. During our baseline model test, the model produced an extremely large number of NaN empty predictions, which skews the metric scores (in addition to being completely useless from an end user perspective). Using the latter three sources listed below and some testing, we were able to determine a hyperparameter setup for the BART model's encode() and generate() functions that eliminated this problem completely. This advanced model implements these changes, and in 25,000 predictions output zero null values.\n",

    "\n",
    "As can be seen above, disappointingly, our model, after one epoch of fine-tuning/training, did not perform very well in comparison to our baseline model. BERTScore recall did increase by 3% (from 86 to 89), but all other metrics dropped by a few percentage points. However, it is worth noting that our baseline model produced an extremely large number of null values (and this one produced none !), which would skew the way these metrics would evaluate the model, so a direct comparison is not as meaningful as it could be. \n",
    "\n",
    "As was discussed in class, numeric n-gram based metrics like ROUGE can only be so valuable for complex NLP tasks like text summarization, as a model can semantically capture a target value without necessarily using the same words or grammar structure, so we are not as discouraged that these scores are lower than the baseline. The BERTScore value, however, is semantic, so this score decreasing is more disheartening. Something we did find interesting was actually reading the model outputs vs the target summaries vs the original inputs ourselves, as this seems to paint a better picture of where the model is in terms of learning and how it is performing. As can be seen in the examples above, the model is capable of producing (mostly) coherent summaries pretty consistently, so that is encouraging. Something we thought was interesting was the way that the model's summary predictions are often longer than the original input text. We realized, a little too late in the project process, that the dataset we chose for this project has entries to be summarized that are, on average, very short (typically no more than a few sentences). We believe this may have been preventative in the model's learning, and makes the task of summarization much more difficult for the model than it would be with a larger corpus of text (which provides more context, and more content for the model to condense into shorthand that makes sense). \"Summarizing\" one sentence in one sentence is difficult, even for a human. We have learned about text summarization throughout the semester, and have a much better understanding of the kind of data that is best suited for this task now than we did in August.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another note based on reading the model's outputs - the model frequently fixated on a word or n-gram and repeated itself several times in a way that sort of \"padded\" summaries in garbage filler. We do believe that this behavior could be lessened with additional and more thorough model training. We only ran our training fit() process for one epoch, with 70,000 rows of training data, and this still took almost 4 hours to complete. This, when combined with the over 14 hours required to run the remaining components of the notebook, made for an over 18 hour process from start to finish. A model test run taking that long was extremely restrictive when it came to testing, debugging, and trial-and-error adjustments, so for the sake of turning the assignment in on time we had to settle for lower performance than we wanted. We are, however, going to continue running the model with additional epochs and more training data until the time of the final project presentation, just to see if we can improve model performance more. If we are able to get better numbers we will report these in our final report and presentation."
