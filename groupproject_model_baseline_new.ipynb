    "We have chosen to use BERTScore and ROGUE as our two metrics for evaluating the performance of our model. We chose to use ROGUE metrics because it is purpose-built for evaluating text summarization, which is the task our model will be completing. We will be generating scores for ROGUE-N (as ROGUE-1 and ROGUE-2), ROUGE-L, and ROUGE-S for the most comprehensive possible model evaluation. ROGUE-1 and ROGUE-2 will observe the number of unigrams and bigrams (respectively) shared between the model output and the \"correct\" output. ROGUE-L measures the longest common subsequence of words shared between the model's output and the true output. ROGUE-S observes shared skipgrams between the model's output and the desired one, this can identify sequences of consecutive words that may be correct in the model's output but are separated by a word or sequence of words. These metrics will provide a method by which to assign accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores when comparing the model's produced summaries with the original human-generated ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to use BERTScore as our second metric because it is another metric that is designed to evaluate how a model's text output compares with a true output. We thought it would be interesting to pair a BERTScore evaluation with our ROGUE evaluations because BERTScore, unlike ROGUE or BLEU, focuses on a semantic comparison of the model's output and the original output, rather than a purely syntactical one. This means, rather than computing a pure accuracy score in terms of how many exact words are matched between the true and model outputs, BERTScore takes into account the meaning of individual words in each output when making evaluations. This can make for an analysis that may be more in line with human intuition."
