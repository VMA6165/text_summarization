    "We have chosen to use BERTScore and ROGUE as our two metrics for evaluating the performance of our model. We chose to use ROGUE metrics because it is purpose-built for evaluating text summarization, which is the task our model will be completing. We will be generating scores for ROGUE-N (as ROGUE-1 and ROGUE-2), ROUGE-L, and ROUGE-S for the most comprehensive possible model evaluation. ROGUE-1 and ROGUE-2 will observe the number of unigrams and bigrams (respectively) shared between the model output and the \"correct\" output. ROGUE-L measures the longest common subsequence of words shared between the model's output and the true output. ROGUE-S observes shared skipgrams between the model's output and the desired one, this can identify sequences of consecutive words that may be correct in the model's output but are separated by a word or sequence of words. These metrics will provide a method by which to assign accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores when comparing the model's produced summaries with the original human-generated ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to use BERTScore as our second metric because it is another metric that is designed to evaluate how a model's text output compares with a true output. We thought it would be interesting to pair a BERTScore evaluation with our ROGUE evaluations because BERTScore, unlike ROGUE or BLEU, focuses on a semantic comparison of the model's output and the original output, rather than a purely syntactical one. This means, rather than computing a pure accuracy score in terms of how many exact words are matched between the true and model outputs, BERTScore takes into account the meaning of individual words in each output when making evaluations. This can make for an analysis that may be more in line with human intuition."

    "We have chosen to use the Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformer (BART) model for our text summarization task. The BART model is a sequence-to-sequence transformer model, utilizing a bidirectional encoder and a left to right decoder, that has been shown to be very effective at processing one body of text and outputting different text in response. Bart learns by \"noising\" (scrambling/shuffling/generally introducing chaos to) a given body of text, and training the seq2seq element of the model to recreate the original text. This allows the seq2seq process to learn the unique semantics, flow, grammar, and construction of the given language, allowing the model to produce (roughly) coherent, novel outputs in the given language in response to presented tasks. This makes BART a strong choice for text summarization, and there are several pre-trained variations of BART that are specialized for this task. In addition to manually lemmatizing and tokenizing the string entries in our dataset during our data preprocessing stage, we decided to also utilize BART's pre-trained built-in tokenizer, converting the data into a vectorized form the model can easily interpret, with the hope of optimizing the model's function. For the actual summarization task, we are employing the base pre-trained form of the BART model. We wanted to use the least-trained form of the model for our baseline performance test, so there would be room for optimization and training during the next \"advanced model\" stage of the project."
